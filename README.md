## how to open project in unity

First you have to install Unity engine (try installing the newest version), remember to also install Android (or iOS) module.
Then clone (or download) the repository.
Open the project in Unity (start Unity -> click open -> select the repository directory).

After opening the project, open the main scene: using Unity's asset browser navigate to the "Scenes" directory and double click "Main" scene.

Now you have to switch platform to Android (or iOS): open File menu -> click Build Settings... -> Select Android (or iOS) -> click Switch Platform.

You can start the game by clicking play button. After starting the game in player you should change aspect ratio to portrait orientation.

Note: You may be confused that after opening the main scene you can't see anything in the editor - you have to zoom out (use mouse scroll wheel to zoom out).
